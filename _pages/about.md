My name is Meghan and in Fall 2025, I will begin a PhD in Mathematics at UC Santa Barbara, where I'll be supported by the Eugene Cota-Robles Fellowship. My research interests are in arithmetic and algebraic geometry. Other long-term interests of mine are in low-dimensional topology and computational algebra.

In Spring 2025, I graduated from the master's program at Wake Forest University, where I was advised by [Abbey Bourdon](https://users.wfu.edu/bourdoam/). For my thesis, I worked toward a classification of j-invariants which arise from an isolated point on the modular curve X_0(n).

In Spring 2023, I graduated cum laude from Occidental College with a BA in Mathematics and with math department honors, for which I wrote a capstone expository paper about the Van Kampen Theorem advised by [Don Lawrence](https://www.oxy.edu/academics/faculty/don-lawrence). In Summer 2022, I was advised by [David Yetter](https://www.math.ksu.edu/~dyetter/) at Kansas State University's NSF-funded REU on a research project about quandles, a complete knot invariant. We studied subquandles via orbit decompositions and subquandle lattices. I received the [Benedict Freedman Prize for Mathematical Promise](https://www.oxy.edu/academics/areas-study/mathematics/students/awards/benedict-freedman-prize-mathematical-promise) in May 2023 â€” a profile from my time at Occidental can be found [here](https://www.oxy.edu/academics/areas-study/mathematics/meet-our-majors#Meghan).

I'm the 2025-2027 Student Column editor for the monthly Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM) [newsletter](https://awm-math.org/publications/newsletter/), which accepts submissions covering anything related to the student experience in mathematics, ranging from personal math journeys to advice for other students. If you're an undergraduate or graduate student and are interested in contributing to a future issue, please contact me!
